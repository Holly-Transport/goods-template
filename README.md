## Practice Group Data Goods Template

**Data Goods**Â are comprised of data, reproducible methods (code), documentation for sharing with counterparts, and sample insights and indicators. Unlike traditional data analysis, which results in a single-use report or visualization, Data Goods are designed to be customized, reused, and updated, thereby building the capacity of the World Bank and partner organizations to quickly and effectively deliver complex data science solutions to pressing global challenges.
