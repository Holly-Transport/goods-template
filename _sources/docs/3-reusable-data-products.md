# Reusable Data Products

**Reusable Data Products** are produced using the **Foundational Datasets** and can be further used to generate indicators and insights. All Data Products include documentation, references to original data sources (and/or information on how to access them), and a description of their limitations.

Following is a summary of Data Products prepared for this Data Good:

<the following table is a sample -- replace with actual sources, with hyperlinks to each data product>

| ID  | Name                                       | Description                                                         | Limitations                                                                                                                                                                                    | Foundational Datasets Used (ID#) |
| --- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| A   | Observed changes in NightLight Data        | Weekly aggregated trends in nighttime luminosity                    | Changes in nighttime lights could be driven by multiple factors—such as rescue efforts generating lights, to damages and people leaving high-hit areas causing a reduction in nighttime lights | 1,2                              |
| B   | Observed Impact of Conflict Events on PoIs | Daily activity of conflict events overlayed with Points of Interest | The Points of Interest are obtained from OSM, which is crowdsourced and does not have a fixed refresh schedule.                                                                                | 1,3,5                            |

Each Data Product is produced according to the following outline:

1. Data Product Overview

2. Data

3. Methodology (and code)

4. Findings

5. Limitations

6. References
