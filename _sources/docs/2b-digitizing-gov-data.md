# Digitizing Government Data

The World Bank DEC and Digital Development teams can support training government statistical offices on: digitizing paper data records and transferring data that resides on desktops into cloud-based databases. Further, the DEC Office of the Chief Statistician can provide support for piloting Large Language Model (LLM) and AI-based methods to help governments quickly tag and search their existing data, using natural language queries.

## Digitizing Data

The World Bank Development Economics Data Group (DECDG) supports National Statistical Offices on both modernizing data collection methods (see next chapter) and digitizing existing data. Data digitalization is critical to unlocking the value of decades of historical data and trends, supporting informed decisionmaking moving forward.
