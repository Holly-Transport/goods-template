# Digitizing Government Data

The World Bank DEC and Digital Development teams can support training government statistical offices on: digitizing paper data records and transferring data that resides on desktops into cloud-based databases. Further, the DEC Office of the Chief Statistician can provide support for piloting Large Language Model (LLM) and AI-based methods to help governments quickly tag and search their existing data, using natural language queries.
