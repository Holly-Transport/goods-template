# Work Plan Example

## Background

The Clean Water and Sanitation Global Challenge Program  seeks to strengthen water security and increase access to safe water supply and sanitation through systems change and investing in the scale-up of more sustainable water management and disaster risk reduction solutions. To this end, the Approach Paper annex presents data requirements to measure outcomes in the four GCP Pillars. Following is an excerpt from the paper:

> Measuring the various outcomes listed in the GCP pillars requires data on various indicators including access to safe water supply and sanitation, irrigation practices, flood and drought risk, water resource mapping, and conflict risk. The GCP will support, and piggyback on on-going World Bank led data collection initiatives and data partnerships. For example, DECDG supports data production on WASH, irrigation, and climate risk related information and collaborates with relevant institutions in this area to ensure data are used both to monitor global and national goals as well as to support World Bank projects. These initiatives can be further strengthened to meet the data requirements of each pillar:
>
> * Pillar 1: Achieving universal access to safe water supply and sanitation.
> * Pillar 2: Scaling up climate resilient irrigation to increase food production and water productivity
> * Pillar 3: Reducing flood and drought risks through sustainable water resources management
> * Pillar 4: Enhancing Water Security in FCV for peace and stability.

Through the GCP process, the Water GP has clearly articulated its priorities and goals. Whether or not the GCP proceeds, the Water GP can still be supported in acheivement of these data and analytical goals, through preparation of a Data Good, per the following proposed work plan:

## Datasets

### Existing Data

As a first step, the Lab team will explore options to curate a hosted collection of relevant datasets, including but not limited to:

* Spatial population and demographics

* Spatial distribution of wealth

* Location of surface natural freshwater resources and spatial trends in their increase/descrease

* Location of flood plains /  risk zones

* Historical spatial statistics for drought and rainfall

* Location of agriculture facilities

* Location of basic infrastructure, including roads and buildings, and points of interest, such as schools and health facilities

* Disease surveillence data for illnesses associated with contaminated water and poor sanitation (e.g., cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio)

* Spatial and temporal inventory of international development organization investments in WASH facilities

* WASH consumables purchase data (e.g., from Unilever)

* Previously conducted household survey results (e.g., LSMS), formatted for ease of access and use

* Conflict event data (geospatial)

* Aggregated news and media mentions of poor WASH conditions

  

### Digitized Government Data

As a pilot, the team can work with a specific counry client to aggregate and digitize existing paper records or tag and format existing digital records. These would then be hosted on a server (location depending on local data regulations) and made easily searchable and discoverable through an open-source AI-based document and data discovery platform developed by the World Bank. 



### New Data Collection

* The **Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)** is launching a new program on longitudinal high-frequency multi-topic household surveys, known as Resilient Futures. Through coordination with the Water Global Practice, the survey questions can be tailored to ensure they support measurement of access to safe water supply and sanitation, irrigation practices, and sustainable water resource management practices. 
* The team can use **remote sensing** techniques to monitor and provide statistics on freshwater cover, flood plains, and other natural features that support the 4 pillars.
