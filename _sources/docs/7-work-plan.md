# Work Plan Example: Water GCP

## Background

The Clean Water and Sanitation Global Challenge Program  seeks to strengthen water security and increase access to safe water supply and sanitation through systems change and investing in the scale-up of more sustainable water management and disaster risk reduction solutions. To this end, the Approach Paper annex presents data requirements to measure outcomes in the four GCP Pillars. Following is an excerpt from the paper:

> Measuring the various outcomes listed in the GCP pillars requires data on various indicators including access to safe water supply and sanitation, irrigation practices, flood and drought risk, water resource mapping, and conflict risk. The GCP will support, and piggyback on on-going World Bank led data collection initiatives and data partnerships. For example, DECDG supports data production on WASH, irrigation, and climate risk related information and collaborates with relevant institutions in this area to ensure data are used both to monitor global and national goals as well as to support World Bank projects. These initiatives can be further strengthened to meet the data requirements of each pillar:
> 
> * Pillar 1: Achieving universal access to safe water supply and sanitation.
> * Pillar 2: Scaling up climate resilient irrigation to increase food production and water productivity
> * Pillar 3: Reducing flood and drought risks through sustainable water resources management
> * Pillar 4: Enhancing Water Security in FCV for peace and stability.

Through the GCP process, the Water GP has clearly articulated its priorities and goals. Whether or not the GCP proceeds, the Water GP can still be supported in acheivement of these data and analytical goals, through preparation of a Data Good, per the following proposed work plan.

## Proposed Work Outputs

#### Contributions to World Bank Water Data Portal

> The team can support the the [World Bank Water Data Portal](https://wbwaterdata.org/) by contributing harmonized statistics derived from previously conducted and planned WB-led [Living Standards Measurement Study](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/lsms/?page=1&ps=15&repo=lsms) household surveys, supporting analysis of risks to safe water supply and access, especially in FCVs. 
> 
>  The team can also support development and Portal publication of new statistics that support GCP indicator requirements, such as:
> 
> * <u>Baseline Spatial Location and Number of People Vulnerable to Flood and Drought Risk</u> for use in analyzing impact of sustainable water resource management programs.
> 
> * <u>Baseline Spatial Agricultural Relative Yield Index</u> for use in analyzing impact of investments in improved irrigation services and mnew agriculture technology.

#### Government Capacity Building Program for Digitalizing and Standardizing Water-Related Data Collection Systems

> **Direct Government Data Capacity Building**. The GCP would support direct training to National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and relevant sector ministries for digitalizing and standardizing water-related data collection systems – especially household surveys and geospatial data collection -- in parallel with the Digitalization GCP, which has a focus on modernizing primary data collection systems and establishing standards for data exchange between ministries. 
> 
> This work would build on existing programs that are currently executed on an ad-hoc basis, but through the GCP, can be more systemized under a common framework. For example, the WB currently supports government data production on WASH, irrigation, and climate risk related information and collaborates with relevant institutions in this area (JMP- UNICEF and WHO) to ensure data are used both to monitor global and national goals as well as to support World Bank projects. 
> 
> To illustrate, a DECDG team designed and trained the Ethiopian government on implementation drinking water quality surveys in collaboration with the Joint Monitoring Programme of UNICEF and WHO – [Drinking water quality surveys in Ethiopia,.](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2783/related-materials) This work informed a US$300m IDA program, “[One WASH](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/577341560737014064/pdf/Ethiopia-Consolidated-Water-Supply-Sanitation-and-Hygiene-Account-Project.pdf)” as well as [official SDG 6 reporting](https://www.sdg6data.org/en/country-or-area/ethiopia#anchor_6.1.1). Further, the team followed the survey work by designing methods for [addressing gaps in data on drinking water quality through data integration and machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41545-023-00272-8). Training material preparation and delivery would be via ASAs or as TA components of IBRD/IDA lending activities. 

> **Scaled Data Capacity Building**. To quickly scale capacity building activities, the GCP may leverage the **WB Development Economics Global Institute** program, which leads data systems training programs to client country-based academic and research organizations that provide training to national and sub-national governments. Training material preparation could be supported through the Global Data Facility and as ASA.

#### Improved Data Discoverability with AI

> **Country Pilots**. The team may support country pilots in using language learning models and generative AI to expedite digitizing water-related records (e.g., auto-tagging with meta data) and improving data and information discoverability – water, climate, and other datasets being coordinated through other GCPs. Discoverability would be improved through use of natural language queries, which would help increase government uptake. Depending on the status of data digitization, data discoverability pilots can be implemented, scaled, and reproduced relatively quickly across the portfolio through DPL and TA components of IPF programs, led by the WB Data Catalogue team.



> **World Bank Water Data Portal Improvements.** The World Bank Water Data Portal can be improved with additional funcitonality that supports AI-based document and data discovery, such as using the DECDG open source platform, [NLP4Dev](https://www.nlp4dev.org/). 

#### Improved Monitoring and Evaluation with Satellites

> Several aspects of the GCP could be supported through monitoring by satellite remote sensing – using both open and commercially available sources – for a scaled and rapid approach to understanding climatic impacts on GCP objectives. The DECDG Geospatial Operations Support Team (GOST), which manages several master license agreements with satellite imagery and remote sensing data providers, could provide cross support to IBRD/IDA programs and/or, via ASA, develop framework approaches.



## Work Organization

The work is organized around four parts:

1. Datasets

2. Data Products

3. Insights and Indicators

4. Training

The finally-produced web book that includes all relevant outputs and materials will be prepared for a pilot country but then, by design, scaleable to be fully replicated in new countries. 



### 1 Datasets

#### 1a Existing Global and Pilot Country Data

As a first step, the Lab team will explore options to curate a hosted collection of relevant datasets (both from the Water Data Portal and from new sources), including but not limited to:

* Spatial population and demographics

* Spatial distribution of wealth

* Location of surface natural freshwater resources and spatial trends in their increase/descrease

* Location of flood plains /  risk zones

* Historical spatial statistics for drought and rainfall

* Location of agriculture facilities

* Location of basic infrastructure, including roads and buildings, and points of interest, such as schools and health facilities

* Disease surveillence data for illnesses associated with contaminated water and poor sanitation (e.g., cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio)

* Spatial and temporal inventory of international development organization investments in WASH facilities

* WASH consumables purchase data (e.g., from Unilever)

* Previously conducted household survey results (e.g., LSMS), formatted for ease of access and use

* Conflict event data (geospatial)

* Aggregated news and media mentions of poor WASH conditions
  
  

#### 1b Digitized Government Data

As a pilot, the team can work with a specific counry client to aggregate and digitize existing paper records or tag and format existing digital records. These data would then be hosted on a server (location depending on local data regulations) and made searchable and discoverable through an open-source AI-based document and data discovery platform developed by the World Bank. 

The outputs of this task would include:

* Customizable Web-Based Guidebook for Digitizing Water Ministry (and/or other relevant and participating Government Department) Paper Records

* Cutomizable Web-Based Guidebook for Water Data Management (e.g, making existing data discoverable, sharable, and usable).

* Customizable Web-Based Training Materials (Script, Presentations, Hands-On Exercises, etc.) for Pilot Government Counterpart for Data Digitization and Management

* Open-Source Code for Using Large Language Models to Make Data Discoverable

* Custom Catalogue Platform (with user interface design and hosting supported by a local vendor) for Data Discovery

* Implementation Support in Pilot Country



#### 1c New Data Collection

The Lab team will discuss new data collection needs with the Water GP based on their most urgent priorities. For starters, the Lab recommends inclusion of the followign two methods in a new data collection plan. 

* The **Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)** is launching a new program on longitudinal high-frequency multi-topic household surveys, known as Resilient Futures. Through coordination with the Water Global Practice, the survey questions can be tailored to ensure they support measurement of access to safe water supply and sanitation, irrigation practices, and sustainable water resource management practices. 
* The team can use **remote sensing** techniques to monitor and provide statistics on freshwater cover, flood plains, and other natural features that support the four pillars.
