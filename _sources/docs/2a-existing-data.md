# Existing Data

Sifting through hundreds of resources to identify existing data that may support a project can be overwhelming. As part of every Data Good, the Lab team prepares curated data resources that gives teams a laser focus on those resources that will have the most impact in their work. 

- [Foundational Datasets Table for Data Goods](2a-existing-data.md/#foundational-datasets-table) - All datasets needed to support use and re-use of the Data Good
- [Strategic Briefs](#strategic-brief) - Briefs, which are prepared on demand for specific projects, feature more comprehensive list of datasources, including those that are not necessarily used to support Data Goods but may nevertheless be useful in support of the broader project aims.
- [Development Data Partnership](#development-data-partnership) - The Data Lab manages ~30 pro-bono data sharing agreements with tech companies on behalf of all World Bank staff. 
- [Data Management](#data-management) - For open datasets, the Data Lab works with the DECDG Development Data Hub team to create a 'collection' in the [World Bank Data Catalogue](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/home) to ensure all datasets are readily accessible by the project team, government counterparts, and third parties.

## Foundational Datasets Table

The Foundational Existing Datasets table includes a description of the data and their update frequency, as well as access links and contact information for questions about use and access.

Following is an example table used to support bi-weekly infrastructure damage estimates for the MTI economics team responsible for the World Bank response to the Gaza-Israel conflict:

## Strategic Brief

For specific needs, the Lab can also prepare a more robust dataset list that includes a more comprehensive list of datasources,  including those that are not necessarily used to support Data Goods but may nevertheless be useful in support of the broader project aims. The following example is a video snippet from the Lab's [Turkiye Earthquake Strategic Brief](https://datapartnership.org/turkiye-earthquake-impact/reports/turkiye-earthquake-strategic-brief.html):

## Development Data Partnership

The [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/) supports data sharing and data science collaboration between international organizations and companies. Through the Partnership, World Bank teams can apply to access ~30 pro-bono data sharing agreements signed with tech companies on behalf of all staff.

## Data Management

For open datasets, the Data Lab works with the DECDG Development Data Hub team to create a 'collection' in the [World Bank Data Catalogue](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/home) to ensure all datasets are readily accessible by the project team, government counterparts, and third parties.

> *Fig. 2* The Data Lab worked with the DEC Data Group (DECDG) Development Data Hub team to create a special [Syria Economic Monitor collection](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/getting-started) in the World Bank Data Catalogue to ensure all project data can be easily accessed by the team and third parties. Similar collections can be made for other Data Goods packages, to ensure all data are hosted and readily accessible from one place.
