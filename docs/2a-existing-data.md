# Existing Data

Sifting through hundreds of resources to identify existing data that may support a project can be overwhelming. As part of every Data Good, the Lab team prepares curated data resources that gives teams a laser focus on those resources that will have the most impact in their work.

- **Dataset Curation** - The Lab pools together and categorizes existsing datasets -- public and private -- that could support the project and, critically, provides direct links for accessing / applying for these resources.

- **Development Data Partnership** - The Data Lab manages ~30 pro-bono data sharing agreements with tech companies on behalf of all World Bank staff.

## Dataset Curation

The Lab prepares curated datasets that include data used to support production of data products and insights, as well as additional resources that may useful in support of the broader project aims. The following example is from the Lab's [Turkiye Earthquake Strategic Brief](https://datapartnership.org/turkiye-earthquake-impact/reports/turkiye-earthquake-strategic-brief.html):

## Development Data Partnership

Curated datasets also draw upon the Data Lab's [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/), which supports data sharing and data science collaboration between international organizations and companies. Through the Partnership, World Bank teams can apply to access ~30 pro-bono data sharing agreements signed with tech companies on behalf of all staff: <https://datapartnership.org/>. To date, the Partnesrhip program has supported more than 300 projects.
