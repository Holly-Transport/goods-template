# Work Plan Example

## Background

The Health Emergency Prevention, Prepardness, and Response (HEPPR) Global Challenge Program (GCP) seeks to enhance capacity to prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies by strengthening health systems and supporting a One Health approach at country, regional and global levels. The GCP supports three focus areas:



1. > **Core public health, health system, and multisectoral capacities**. The capacity of countries and regional institutions to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies depends on core public health and multisectoral capacities, such as surveillance and EWS, laboratories, risk communication, One Health coordination, as well as a resilient and emergency-ready health system. The GCP will complement the current portfolio and pipeline of health system strengthening projects and investments by systematically scaling up support to strengthen specific capacities and health system gaps, including by leveraging private sector capacities.
   
   
2. > **Rapid and scaled response financing during emergencies**. When health emergencies happen, rapid and scaled financing is essential to contain their scope and impact. In many contexts, both domestic and international financing is required but plans need to be in place (and stress-tested) to activate that financing. Building on the World Bank’s Crisis Response Toolkit, the GCP will help expand the use of contingent financing instruments and ensure that country crisis response plans and public financial management systems are fit-for-purpose in health emergencies. The GCP will also provide a platform for engaging donors, global health institutions, development finance institutions and other stakeholders to strengthen coordination of crisis response financing (including for the private sector) and fill gaps in areas such as at-risk and surge financing in the context of health emergencies.
   
   
3. > **Equitable access to MCMs**. Containing health emergencies and mitigating their health impacts often depend on the availability of and equitable access to MCMs, including diagnostics, vaccines, pharmaceuticals, devices, and personal protective equipment (PPE). Building on the ongoing efforts by the WBG in strengthening localized capacities and enabling environment for the manufacturing and distribution of MCMs, the GCP will enable a systemic analysis and creation of regional approaches to shaping these markets.



The Approach Paper identifies specific areas of collaboration with DEC on data strenghtening:



> The GCP is being co-designed with DEC and will focus on two strategic areas for data strengthening: i) curating and hosting global datasets and methods that support delivery of key GCP investments; ii) building government and staff capacity for collecting, digitizing and using data to support GCP activities. The GCP will make an effort to improve gender-disaggregation of data and analyses.   



Specific examples are presented in Annex 7: Examples of Data Initiatives;



> For global datasets, hosted on the World Bank’s open data catalogue (~14+ million users per month), the GCP will support building pillar-specific collections – harmonizing relevant commonly used open, survey (e.g., LSMS), and geospatial data (e.g., air quality derived via remote sensing) for use by Bank staff and government clients pursuing GCP goals. The curated data collection would be accompanied by peer-reviewed code and methods for combining the global datasets with local information to generate project-specific analytics. These would include development and curation of methods for using non-traditional data to fill critical information gaps – e.g., mobile device location data monitor changes in volume of health facility visits in response to external shocks.

> 
> Regarding government capacity building around data, the GCP may support country pilots in using large language models and generative AI to expedite digitizing health records (e.g., auto-tagging with meta data) and improving data and information discoverability -- health and other datasets being coordinated through other GCPs. The GCP would also support direct data training to health ministries, so that before a health crisis or during, government staff can access and use relevant datasets (including those being created through other GCPs). 



Through the GCP process, the Health Global Practice (GP) has clearly articulated its priorities and goals. Whether or not the GCP proceeds, the Health GP can still be supported in acheivement of these data and analytical goals, through preparation of a Data Good, per the following proposed work plan:

## Datasets

### Existing Data

As a first step, the Lab team will explore options to curate a hosted collection of relevant datasets, including but not limited to:

* Spatial population and demographics

* Spatial distribution of wealth

* Location of basic infrastructure, including roads and buildings, and points of interest relevant to health emergencies, such as schools and health facilities

* Disease surveillence data for illnesses associated with contaminated water and poor sanitation (e.g., cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio)

* Previously conducted relevant household survey results (e.g., LSMS), especially those that could support understanding of the social determinants of health, formatted for ease of access and use

* Conflict event data (geospatial)

* Aggregated news and media mentions of poor health conditions

* Geospatial data relevant to understanding environmental determinants of health

### Digitized Government Data

As a pilot, the team can work with a specific counry client to aggregate and digitize existing paper records or tag and format existing digital records. These would then be hosted on a server (location depending on local data regulations) and, depending on data security classification, made easily searchable and discoverable through an open-source AI-based document and data discovery platform developed by the World Bank. 



### New Data Collection

* The **Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS)** is launching a new program on longitudinal high-frequency multi-topic household surveys, known as Resilient Futures. Through coordination with the Health Global Practice, the survey questions can be tailored to ensure they support a better understanding of the social determinants of health and health emergency prepardness. 
* The team can use **remote sensing** techniques to monitor environmental conditions corrolated with health emergencies. 
  
  

## Data Products

After exhausting methjofs for curating existing data, digitizing government data, and collecting new field data, the team will undertake the development and curation of methods for using non-traditional data to fill critical information gaps – e.g., mobile device location data monitor changes in volume of health facility visits in response to external shocks, or social media data to monitor trends in mental health. 



## Training

The team would support direct training to health ministries for all activites related to data and data products, so that, either before a health crisis or during, government staff have can access and use relevant datasets to quickly identify vulnerable populations using social and environmental health determinant and achieve other objectives of the GCP.
