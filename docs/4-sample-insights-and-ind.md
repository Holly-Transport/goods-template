# Insights, Indicators, and Data Sources

This section shows how Curated Datasets and Reusable Data Products can be combined to generate new insights and indicators. The section also incldues information about how analytical reproducibility is acheived through presentaiton of underlying datasets. 

- Insights and Indiators. 
- Data Goods Datasets Table
- World Bank Data Catalogue Collection



## Insights and Indicators

Datasets and Data Products can be combined to generate new kinds of insights and indicators. FOr example, the following comparable indicators were developed by the Lab to support the Turkiye Country Economist in analyzing earthquake impacts on the economy.

## Data Goods Datasets Table

The Data Goods Datasets Table pools together all datasets used to produce data products, insights, and indicators. The table includes data descriptions, license type, and update frequency, as well as access links and contact information for questions about use and access. With this table, combined with the data products methods, all insights and indicators produced for the Data Good can be readily replicated by World Bank staff. 

Following is an example table of a Data Goods Datasets Table prepared for the Syria Economic Monitor Team (note, most non-open datasets are only available to Syria team members, with the requisite permissions):

## Data Catalog Collection

For datasets created by the Bank and/or licesned by the Bank, the Data Lab works with the DECDG Development Data Hub team to create a 'collection' in the [World Bank Data Catalogue](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/home) to ensure all datasets are readily accessible by the project team, government counterparts, and third parties. 

For example, the Data Lab worked with the DEC Data Group (DECDG) Development Data Hub team to create a special [Syria Economic Monitor collection](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/int/getting-started) in the World Bank Data Catalogue to ensure all project data can be easily accessed by the team and third parties. Similar collections can be made for other Data Goods packages, to ensure all data are hosted and readily accessible from one place.
